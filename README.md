## Writing

- **Why Softmax? A Hypothesis Testing Perspective on Attention Weights**  
  https://peter-fields.github.io/why-softmax/  
  Softmax is ubiquitous in transformers, yet its role in attention can feel more heuristic than inevitable (at least to me). In this post, I try to make it feel more natural and show how this interpretation suggests useful diagnostics for the often circuit-like behavior of attention heads.

## Research interests

- Statistical physics perspectives on learning and generalization
- Mechanistic / mathematical views of representation learning (KL geometry, exponential families, energy-based models)
- Applications of stat phys and machine learning to biology
